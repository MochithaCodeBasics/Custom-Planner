# Project Overview: Bootcamp Custom Planner

The **Bootcamp Custom Planner** is a personalization engine designed to generate custom learning roadmaps for students based on their experience, goals, and availability. It transforms a static syllabus into a tailored learning journey.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture

The project follows a modern Next.js structure:

- `app/`: Contains the routing and UI components for the main application and admin dashboard.
- `lib/`: Houses the core business logic, including the roadmap generation engine and shared types.
- `data/`: Stores the raw syllabus data in JSON format.
- `components/`: Reusable UI components (buttons, selects, cards, etc.).
- `scripts/`: This is where they are split by purpose:
    - **Top-level `scripts/`**: Contains utility scripts for **Data Migration and Maintenance** (e.g., generating `syllabus_v3.json` or fixing specific chapter durations). These are run manually by developers.
    - **`bootcamp-planner/scripts/`**: Intended for scripts specifically tied to the Next.js build process or automated environment setup.

## 🔑 Key Files & Components

### 1. Recommendation Engine: [generatePlan.ts](file:///c:/Users/User/bootcamp_custom_planner/bootcamp_custom_planner/bootcamp-planner/lib/generatePlan.ts)
This is the heart of the project. It contains the `generatePlan` function which:
- **Filters**: Removes chapters the user already knows (experience-based) or doesn't need for their specific goal (goal-based).
- **Adapts**: Adjusts the duration of modules based on the user's profile (beginner/pro) and motivation.
- **Schedules**: Calculates the total timeline based on weekly availability (e.g., 5-10 hours vs. Full-time).

### 2. Knowledge Base: [syllabus_v3.json](file:///c:/Users/User/bootcamp_custom_planner/bootcamp_custom_planner/bootcamp-planner/data/syllabus_v3.json)
The source of truth for all bootcamp content. It defines subjects (Python, ML, GenAI) and their constituent chapters, including suggested durations and metadata.

### 3. User Interface: [page.tsx](file:///c:/Users/User/bootcamp_custom_planner/bootcamp_custom_planner/bootcamp-planner/app/page.tsx)
The entry point for the user, collecting preferences through a step-by-step UI and displaying the final generated roadmap.

## ⚙️ Admin Panel & Data Reflection

A major feature of this project is the **immediate reflection** of syllabus changes in the generated roadmaps. Here is how that works:

### 1. The Source of Truth (Base Store)
The entire syllabus is stored in a single JSON file: [syllabus_v3.json](file:///c:/Users/User/bootcamp_custom_planner/bootcamp_custom_planner/bootcamp-planner/data/syllabus_v3.json). In this project, the **"Base Store" is the server's local filesystem**.

### 2. Admin Panel Updates
- **Interface**: The [Admin Panel](file:///c:/Users/User/bootcamp_custom_planner/bootcamp_custom_planner/bootcamp-planner/app/admin/page.tsx) provides a specialized UI to edit this syllabus.
- **Persistence**: When an admin saves changes, the frontend sends a `PUT` request to the [Syllabus API](file:///c:/Users/User/bootcamp_custom_planner/bootcamp_custom_planner/bootcamp-planner/app/api/syllabus/route.ts).
- **Filesystem Write**: The API uses [syllabusStore.ts](file:///c:/Users/User/bootcamp_custom_planner/bootcamp_custom_planner/bootcamp-planner/lib/syllabusStore.ts), which utilizes the Node.js `fs/promises` library to **physically overwrite** the `syllabus_v3.json` file on the server's disk.

### 3. Dynamic Roadmap Generation
- **Fetching**: The main application [page.tsx](file:///c:/Users/User/bootcamp_custom_planner/bootcamp_custom_planner/bootcamp-planner/app/page.tsx) fetches the latest syllabus from `/api/syllabus` as soon as it loads.
- **Calculation**: When a user generates a roadmap, the `generatePlan` engine takes this *freshly fetched* syllabus data and applies the user's personal filters (experience, goal, availability).
- **Result**: Any module renamed, chapter added, or duration adjusted in the Admin panel is **instantly applied** to any new roadmap generated by a user.

## ✂️ The "Syllabus Chiseling" Logic

The core value of the planner lies in "chiseling" away the parts of the syllabus that a specific user doesn't need or adapting durations to fit their pace. This logic is handled in [generatePlan.ts](file:///c:/Users/User/bootcamp_custom_planner/bootcamp_custom_planner/bootcamp-planner/lib/generatePlan.ts).

### 1. Hard Filtering (Skipping)
The engine removes entire chapters based on two criteria:
- **Experience-Based**: If a user marks "Python" or "SQL" as already known, the `PYTHON_BASICS_IDS` or `SQL_BASICS_IDS` are removed from the plan entirely.
- **Goal-Based**: If a user's goal is "ML Engineer", deep "NLP" modules are filtered out to keep the focus sharp.

### 2. Smart Selection (Internships)
The engine doesn't just filter; it *chooses*. For example:
- **GenAI Specialists**: Automatically assigned the "RAG Internship".
- **ML/CV Engineers**: Automatically assigned the "Computer Vision Internship".

### 3. Category-Based Adapting (Multipliers)
The engine uses **Subject Categories** to apply specific scaling logic:
- **`foundation` Category**: Durations are scaled by the `profileMultiplier`. For example, a Beginner gets `1.25x` more time on foundation subjects like Python or Stats, while a Pro gets `0.8x`.
- **`career` Category**: If a user's motivation is "First Job", subjects in the career category (like Resume Building or Mock Interviews) are automatically scaled by `1.5x` to ensure depth.
- **`core-ai` & `specialization` Categories**: These categories are primarily used for organizing the syllabus data and ensuring the correct subjects are included based on the user's target goal.
- **Role-Specific Quick-Starts**: Software Developers get a `0.5x` duration reduction on Python basics (since they already know how to code).

### 4. Availability Scaling
Finally, the "Weeks" are calculated by applying an `availabilityFactor`:
- **Full-time (40h/week)**: Multiplies base weeks by `0.4`.
- **Very Slow (3-5h/week)**: Multiplies base weeks by `3.5`.

## 🔄 End-to-End Flow

1. **User Input**: The user selects their current role, goals, technical experience, and time availability.
2. **Logic Processing**: The UI calls `generatePlan`, passing the user preferences and the syllabus data.
3. **Filtering**: The engine strips away irrelevant modules (e.g., skips "Python Basics" if the user is already a Dev).
4. **Time Calculation**: The engine applies multipliers (e.g., a "Career Starter" might need extra time on career-focused modules).
5. **Output**: A personalized sequence of Modules (Phases) is returned with estimated weeks and months.
6. **Visualization**: The UI renders these phases into a beautiful, interactive roadmap.
